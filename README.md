## Wheat Kernel Classification Dataset
This project utilizes the Seeds Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains geometric measurements of wheat kernels, which are useful for classification tasks such as distinguishing between different varieties of wheat. The data is structured as tensors, with each feature representing a specific attribute of the wheat grains.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following fields, each represented as a tensor:

area_A: Area of the wheat grains.

perimeter_P: Perimeter of the wheat grains.

compactness_C: Compactness of the wheat grains.

length_of_kernel: Length of each wheat kernel.

width_of_kernel: Width of each wheat kernel.

asymmetry_coefficient: Asymmetry coefficient of a wheat kernel.

length_of_kernel_groove: Length of the kernel groove.

These features are derived from geometric properties of wheat kernels and are commonly used for classification and analysis tasks.
